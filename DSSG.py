        ### Predicting Economic Growth through Educational Attainment. 
        **Main Goal:** Analyze the impact of educational attainment on economic growth and development.  
        
        **Main Challenge:** Investigate the correlation between education metrics, e.g. literacy rates, school enrollment rates, educational expenditures etc., and economic indicators, e.g., GDP growth, employment rates etc. Develop models to predict how improvements in education could drive economic growth in different regions.
